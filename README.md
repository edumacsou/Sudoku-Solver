Sudoku is a Japanese game, based on a table with 81 fields, called cells, separated in 9 minor 3x3 squares, which must be filled with numbers from 1 to 9 following the rule: 
    A number can only appear once on each row, column and minor square.
A perfect sudoku has only one solution, but a sudoku with more solutions can be solved too, but it demands a guess.
